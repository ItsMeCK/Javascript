<!--HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
-->

<!--onchange	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	The browser has finished loading the page-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<!--Onclick-->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

</body>
</html>
